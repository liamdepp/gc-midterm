    <p>
      Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal
      named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of ninja monkeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very clever monkeys indeed, known for their ingenious teamwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monkeys trained their entire lives for whatever mission they would be
      sent on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their master Kai-Yun sent them out to defeat the great Professor David.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way to clash with David, the monkeys ran into a beggar, Mitch.
