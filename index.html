    <p>
      Once upon a time in the mystical land of Downtown Detroit there dwelt an
      immortal named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of ninja students.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very clever students indeed, known for their ingenious teamwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      The students trained their entire lives for whatever mission they would be
      sent on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their master David sent them out to defeat the evil Professor David.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way to clash with Professor David, the students ran into a
      beggar, Mitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monekeys kindly gave Mitch some money and advised him spend it on a
      coding bootcamp
    </p>
    <p>
      However. Mitch did not spend the money on a coding bootcamp and gave the
      money to Professor David to fund his army of robots.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his evil army of coding robots, David trapped the students in an
      infinite loop. The end.
